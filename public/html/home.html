                            CRLS Course Connect is a website where CRLS students can 
                            search for courses they are considering signing up for 
                            and get more information by connecting with mentors who 
                            have taken those courses.

                                through a particular class, sport, or extracurricular,
                                feel free to introduce yourself this way as well.

                            You can ask your mentor all sorts of questions, but they may be able to 
                            answer some questions better than others. Here are some good questions 
                            to get you started:

                                spend on homework and/or studying for the course?
                            </li>

                                What types of assignments did you have to complete for the course? 
                                Were there a lot of projects? Essays? Tests? Was it a discussion-based 
                                class?
                            </li>

                                What did you enjoy most, or least, about the class? Would you recommend
                                it to someone like me?
                            </li>
